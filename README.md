###TechnoSaft

This project involves building an autonomous car that operates using an Arduino Mega, two DC motors, a servo motor for steering, an infrared sensor, and a PixyCam2 camera. The car navigates its environment by detecting colors and obstacles, and adjusts its direction accordingly.
Introduction
The Autonomous Car Project is designed to demonstrate basic principles of autonomous navigation using simple electronic components and a microcontroller. The car is capable of:

Moving forward by default.
Turning left when it detects any color other than white using the PixyCam2.
Avoiding obstacles detected by the infrared sensor.

#Our story: We started creating the robot because we wanted to improve our knowledge in the robotic maschines industry and to meet new people from new backgrounds.
In our jurney we have faced a bunch of problems like coding errors, projecting errors and ansembling the parts but we have managed to solve all of them. Our team is not based only on perfectioning the project, we are close friend outside the working space and this is why we think our team is special.
